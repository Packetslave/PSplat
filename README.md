# PSplat
2D side-scrolling (platformer) game in p5.js

## Note: 
This code is currently very ugly. It was originally a class exercise for a freshman-level CS course, and was written using their boilerplate and to their coding standards (pre-EC5).

I'm currently in the process of cleaning it up and porting it to a more modern version of Javascript.
